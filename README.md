# GHES Vulnerability Checker

This GitHub Actions workflow automates the process of checking specified CVEs against the dependencies of a given GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) version. 

**Key Features:**

- **Automated Dependency Analysis**: Parses and extracts package names and versions from the GHES dependency metadata without manual intervention.
- **Comprehensive CVE Checking**: Checks each specified CVE against the extracted dependencies using GitHub's Security Advisory GraphQL API.
- **Ubuntu Advisory Integration**: For CVEs not listed in GitHub advisories, provides direct links to Ubuntu's security advisories, ensuring no vulnerability goes unnoticed.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates a clear and concise vulnerability report summarizing the findings, which is uploaded as an artifact for easy access and review.

**Usage Instructions:**

To use this workflow, trigger it manually via the GitHub Actions tab and provide the required inputs:

- **GHES Version (`version`)**: Specify the GHES version you want to check (e.g., `4.2.0`).
- **CVEs to Check (`cves`)**: Enter a comma-separated list of CVE identifiers you wish to assess (e.g., `CVE-2021-34527,CVE-2021-44228`).

**Prerequisites and Notes:**

- Uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authenticating with GitHub's Security Advisory API.
- I have found some packages are marked vulnerable when their version looks good due to being installed in multiple locations.
- This tool is to be used as an aid. Please double-check all the work!

By incorporating this workflow into your security practices, you can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of your vulnerability management for GitHub Enterprise Server deployments.
